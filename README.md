# Nick's Resume üìî

This is my resume, written using LaTeX. Currently a published PDF of
the resume is not available on this repository. To get a copy of my resume
you can either reach out to me at [npw1010@gmail.com](mailto:npw1010@gmail.com)
or build my resume from this repo using XeLaTeX. Instructions for compiling my
resume on a MacBook are given below.

## Compilation üñ•Ô∏è

Prerequisites for compilation include a full XeLaTex installation, the Iosevka
font, and the Helvetica font.

1. Installing prerequisites
    - XeLaTeX installation on MacBook using Brew:

        ```sh
        brew install mactex-no-gui # install mactex, skip if already installed
        ```

    - Iosevka can be installed from their [website, located here](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). Install *Iosevka* and *Iosevka Slab*.

    - Helvetica comes with MacOS, but can also be found online if needed.

2. Copy this repo (or just directly copy [main.tex](./main.tex)) to your local computer.

3. Once [main.tex](./main.tex) is on your local machine, compilation can be
    accomplished by calling XeLaTeX from the command line. Adding
    an output directory is optional, but makes a cleaner build folder.

   - With Output Directory:
       ```sh
       mkdir pdf
       xelatex -output-directory=pdf main.tex
       ```

    - Without Output Directory:
        ```sh
        xelatex main.tex
        ```

Now you should have a PDF of my resume, located either at `pdf/main.pdf` or
`./main.pdf`. If you're interested in hiring me *and* you actually went through
this process I'm very interested in talking with you! Please reach out via the
contact information available on my resume.
